# Kubernetes Cluster Infrastructure

## Overview

This document outlines the infrastructure setup required to securely host web services on a Kubernetes cluster. The services will expose a public API while maintaining secure access to the internal systems hosted in the "internal-assets" virtual network.

## Cloud Provider: AWS EKS

### Architecture:

- **Public Subnets:** For exposing web services via the internet.
- **Private Subnets:** For internal communication and services that need access to the "internal-assets" network.
- **VPC Peering:** Establish a secure connection to the internal systems hosted in the "internal-assets" network.
- **Ingress Controller:** NGINX with SSL termination (using Cert-Manager for automatic Let's Encrypt certificates).
- **Network Policies:** Restrict traffic between namespaces and services, only allowing necessary communication.

### Key Components:

1. **VPC Peering:** Allow secure communication between the Kubernetes cluster and internal systems.
2. **IAM Roles for Service Accounts:** Control access to AWS resources without hardcoding credentials.
3. **Monitoring & Alerting:** 
    - Use **Prometheus** to collect metrics.
    - Set up alerts using **Alertmanager** or **CloudWatch** for connectivity issues to the internal assets.
4. **Automated Deployment:**
    - Use **Helm** for templated deployments.
    - Set up a CI/CD pipeline in **Jenkins** or **GitLab CI**, which builds Docker images and pushes them to ECR. Deploy the services using Helm charts.

### Security Considerations:

- **RBAC (Role-Based Access Control):** Ensure proper access control in the Kubernetes cluster.
- **SSL/TLS Encryption:** Use **Cert-Manager** to automate SSL certificate issuance.
- **Network Policies:** Define traffic rules between pods to isolate services and improve security.
